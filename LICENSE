CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use
and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
the Work and publicly distribute the Work under CC0, thereby dedicating the
Work to the public domain under the conditions stated below.

Definitions

"Copyright and Related Rights" means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights (as defined below), without
regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this
Public Dedication, the phrase "Copyright and Related Rights" includes, but
is not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
     and translate a Work;

 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
     depicted in a Work;

 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;

 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under national implementations thereof,
     including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
     based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
     thereof.

"Effective Technological Measures" means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20
December 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

"Licensed Rights" means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and

and Related Rights that apply to Your use of the Work and that the owner(s)

"Public Domain Dedication" means CC0 or any other instrument or method,
in any form and whether formally published or not, that purports to
dedicate, waive, surrender, grant or otherwise relinquish, in whole or in
part, Copyright and Related Rights in a Work, whether for consideration or
not and whether according to statute or common law, which is recognized as
giving rise to, or as establishing, a public domain in the Work.

"Sui Generis Database Rights" means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the

Public Dedication.

Affirmer's Rights

The Affirmer wants You to enjoy the Work, freely and without restriction,
and You are granted an unlimited, worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable and fully sublicensable license to the Licensed Rights in the
Work to:

  a. reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate and translate
     the Work;

  b. create and reproduce adaptations of the Work provided that any such
     adaptations, including any translations, carry prominent notices stating
     that You changed the Work and include a citation to the original Work
     (e.g., "This is a translation of [original Work]." or "Based on [original
     Work].");

  c. exercise any of the rights granted in (a) or (b) for commercial purposes
     or non-commercial purposes or for any other purpose, even if originally
     for a particular purpose; and

  d. publicly perform, publicly display, communicate and otherwise distribute
     copies of the Work and adaptations of the Work.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by the Affirmer are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).

Waiver

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable
law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

Public License Fallback

Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the
maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all
territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "Fallback License"). The Fallback License shall be
deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
Should any part of the Fallback License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the Fallback License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Limitations and Disclaimers

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
     including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or the absence of latent or
     other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or
     not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable
     law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

     to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0
     or use of the Work.
